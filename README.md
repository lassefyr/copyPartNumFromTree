# copypartnumfromtree
Python script that copies the selected partnumber from modeltree to clipboard. 

Start by doubleclicking the readtrail.pyw (assumes that you have python 3x)

This script reads the latest 20 lines from your trail file (you must set the path to your own trail file location)
filename = "trail.txt"
folder = "c:/PTC/mytrailfileLocation/" <- change this.

Select .prt or .asm from the modeltree and press "CopyToClipboard". Number should be copied to clipboard.
